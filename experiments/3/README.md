# Experiment 3: Partially observed systems

The experiment itself can be run with the files
- `./5_run_rk.jl`
- `./5_run_fenrir.jl`
to create the experimental results for RK and Fenrir, respectively.

`./4_make_seir_trajectory_plot.jl` creates figure 4, demonstrating the experimental setup and the desired results.

`./5_plot_results.jl` creates figure 5 with the main results.
