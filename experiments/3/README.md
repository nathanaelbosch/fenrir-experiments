# Experiment 3: Partially observed systems

The experiment itself can be run with the files
- `./run_rk.jl`
- `./run_fenrir.jl`
to create the experimental results for RK and Fenrir, respectively.

`./make_figure4.jl` creates figure 4, demonstrating the experimental setup and the desired results.

`./make_figure5.jl` creates figure 5 with the main results.
